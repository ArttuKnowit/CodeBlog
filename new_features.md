# New Task

New features were added on 2025-08-13 to the application. Build more tests for these features. Please clone the whole repository again, and this time, build the tests using SeleniumLibrary with Robot Framework. Please refer to the [SeleniumLibrary keyword documentation](https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html#library-documentation-top) on how to use the library effectively.

## New features

### Favorite blog posts

Users can now select favorite blog posts in the application by clicking a star icon next to the blog post name on the blog post page.

### Changing passwords

Users should now be able to change their password.

### User profile page

Users now have a user profile page that lits their blogposts and comments in blog posts, as well as their favorite blogposts. Users can view the profile pages of other users and should see the same information. They can get to another users page through a link in the posts or comments, or by passing it to the URL.

### Reporting

Users can now report posts and comments for inappropriate content.

## Fixed bugs

The developers say that the following bugs in the previous version of the application have been fixed:

* Users can no longer register with no password
* All messages on the page should be green if they're positive and red if they're negative
