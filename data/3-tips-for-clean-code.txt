Tips for Writing Clean Code

Clean code is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It follows conventions and keeps complexity low so others can work with it confidently.

Use meaningful names, keep functions small and focused, and avoid unnecessary abstractions. Prefer clarity over cleverness.

Comments should explain why, not what. Aim for self-explanatory code so comments become the exception, not the rule.

Apply consistent formatting and style across the codebase. Use linters and formatters to automate standards and reduce friction in reviews.
